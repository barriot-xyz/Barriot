## üìÖ Data collection

After a reminder is sent, it's data is pruned from the collection with no way of recovery.

### Polls

As with reminders, a collection is used to keep poll data around until it expires. 
After expiration, the data is pruned from the collection with no way of recovery.

### Interaction usage

Data is kept about your command & component usage. 
As a command is executed, a **command total** is incremented. 
As a button is pressed, a **component total** is incremented. 
After every command executed, it's name will be stored as your **latest command**. 
The latest command is replaced by its previous entry. Command details are not stored.

### Users

Each user has a unique ID provided by Discord. 
Barriot uses this ID to associate you with it's unique entities, such as polls & reminders.
Additionally, Barriot implements functions like translation which require a language to be specified prior to translation. 
These preferred options are defined along with others in Barriots user-entity collection.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data storage

Data is stored in a MongoDB server, locally hosted on the same machine as Barriot itself. 
It is safely protected by a security manager & password system. 
The port MongoDB communicates over is locked externally, so no traffic from outside the machine can interfere with or keep tabs on your data. 
> If this security somehow fails, and your data is somehow grabbed or deleted, 
Barriot will notify you along other users of this event in its built-in notification system.
