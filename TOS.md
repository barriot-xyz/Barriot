## ‼️ Terms of Service

### 📚 Abuse of internal systems

- Attempting to exploit bugs to achieve a negative outcome purposefully.
- Abusing the API by rapid, continuous and unnecessary use of features offered by Barriot.
- Directly stealing feature design and functionality.

If you, the user, are responsible for abusing the API responsible for letting Barriot function as intended in one of the above ways,
discontinuation of service is in order.

### 📑 Freedom of use

Barriot offers complete freedom of use by all Discord users. 
Responsibility for behavior caused by these users and potentially malicious use of certain features in context not mentioned by the prior statement 
is no concern of the team behind Barriot, 
and up to guild management to handle.

### 🚫 Discontinuation of service

Barriot has an internal blacklisting system that can ban users or guilds from using the bot, even if reinvited or used in different context. 
Discontinuation of the service can be performed in 2 ways:

#### Guild-wide abuse

If abuse is recorded guild-wide, it will be blacklisted as a whole. 
This means all users in the guild will be permanently disabled from using Barriot, unless proof can be provided they were no part of the abuse in question.

#### User-only abuse

If abuse is recorded from a single user, they will be blacklisted immediately. 

### ♻️ Appealing

Appealing is possible [here](https://barriot.xyz/appeal). 
Both guild owners and blacklisted users can appeal, both of which need to report sufficient proof to have their blacklist status raised.
